## About Me

My name is Jacob Swanson and I have started codeing in highschool and have been given lots expericen because of it. I gained some in using python, java, and Swift. I am more confident using Java after taking an APJava class in school. I am also confident on swift after making an app for my IOS class. I am also curretntly trying learning to do C#.

## My Projects
- ### [Turret Shot](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Turret-Shot): 
  - This was a game I made using Xcode and SwiftUI to move characters and be the last to survive. I made this for my highschool IOS class. I also had help with the graphics from @ReaganPawlyszyn1. While waiting to take the class I kept myself busy by making a [prototype](https://github.com/JakE-fiSh/Portfolio/tree/main/Turret-Shot_Java) of my game idea using java. Unfortanatly though I wasn't able to finish the prototype.
- ### [Bubble Words](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/BubbleWord):
  - Another fun project that I have worked on is the game Bubble Words. This was a project also made during my highschool IOS class, instead this time I was in a group. My group mates were @90306561 and @Lembke2448. This was done using sprite kit and vectors to launch a ball at letters to score points based on the word it forms.
- ### [Advent of Code](https://github.com/JakE-fiSh/Java-Class): 
  - This was done during my APJava class. Our teacher showed us this website "Advent of Code" and asinged us to do some of their problems. Some were more challenging but I learned a lot from it like importing data from files. I managed to complete 9 of the problems.
- ### [Trigonometry Quiz](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/TrigonometryQuiz):
  - I made this app for my teacher in my last two weeks of school. It is an app to help practicing trigonometry questions.
