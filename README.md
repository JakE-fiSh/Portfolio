## About Me



## My Projects
- [Turret Shot](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Turret-Shot): This was a game I made using Xcode and SwiftUI code. I made this for my highschool IOS class. I also had help with the graphics from one of my classmates. While waiting to take the class I kept myself busy by making a [prototype](https://github.com/JakE-fiSh/Portfolio/tree/main/Turret-Shot_Java) of my game idea using java.
- [Advent to Code](https://github.com/JakE-fiSh/Java-Class): This was done during my APJava class. Our teacher had shown us this website "Advent to Code" and asinged us to do some of these problems.
