## About Me

My name is Jacob Swanson and I have started codeing in highschool and have been given lots expericen because of it. I gained some in using python, java, and Swift. I am more confident using Java after taking an APJava class in school. I am also confident on swift after making an app for my IOS class. I am also curretntly trying learning to do C#.

## My Projects
- ### [Turret Shot](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Turret-Shot): 
  - This was a game I made using Xcode and SwiftUI. I made this for my highschool IOS class. I also had help with the graphics from @ReaganPawlyszyn1. While waiting to take the class I kept myself busy by making a [prototype](https://github.com/JakE-fiSh/Portfolio/tree/main/Turret-Shot_Java) of my game idea using java.
- [Advent to Code](https://github.com/JakE-fiSh/Java-Class): 
  - This was done during my APJava class. Our teacher had shown us this website "Advent to Code" and asinged us to do some of these problems.
