## My Projects
- [Turret Shot](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Turret-Shot): This was a game I made using Xcode and SwiftUI code. I made this for my highschool IOS class. I also had help with the graphics from one of my classmates. While waiting to take the class I kept myself busy by making a [prototype](https://github.com/JakE-fiSh/Portfolio/tree/main/Turret-Shot_Java) of my game idea using java.

## What I learned
- I've learned more on knowing my limitations for makeing projects in a new language.
- I also learned more about swift it self.
- I learned more about making an app. Esspecaily when it comes to games
